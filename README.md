# The CoffeeBot by Chingu Toucans Team 8

This project was created by the Toucans Team 8 (Vik Williamson and Jennifer Lee). This project was inspired by an older Chingu project called TickyBot. But instead of a TickyBot, we thought, "wouldn't it be a great idea if somehow we could automate coffee gifting?" And hence, CoffeeBot was born. :heart_eyes:

## Further thoughts:

This is our first Chingu voyage and it was awesome! It gave us exposure to Agile methodology, remote team partnership, BootStrap, Image Creation, special CSS effects, etc. This project was built on lots of :coffee: :wink:

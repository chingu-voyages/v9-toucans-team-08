# The CoffeeBot by Chingu Toucans Team 8

This project was created by the Toucans Team 8 (Vik Williamson and Jennifer Lee). This project was inspired by an older Chingu project called TickyBot. But instead of a TickyBot, we thought, "wouldn't it be a great idea if somehow we could automate coffee gifting?" And hence, CoffeeBot was born. :heart_eyes:
